Thank you for purchasing the 3D Adventure Game Kit!

A brief documentation can be found within the 3D Adventure game kit folder to aid new users to the project.

For any additional questions, suggestions and feedback, feel free to contact: support@cwaddingham.co.uk.

A few instances of code have been used which have been created by other people in most cases I have attempted to contact the developers and retrieved permission to use their work in the asset. If there are any issues feel free to email me and I will promptly work with you to fix the issue.

Working together with me on this project was my friend Ben Crutchley who created the music which is part of the kit. For any business inquiries on music, email: b.crutchley@hotmail.co.uk.
